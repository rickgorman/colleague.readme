## Intro

Hi, I'm a student of the breath currently residing in Tucson, AZ. I was born in the saguaro-filled deserts of Arizona, grew up bodyboarding on the beaches of Hawaii, went to college for Computer Science and started my first career in IT in the evergreen forests of Oregon. During the pandemic, I relocated from NYC back to Tucson to be closer to family. I enjoy hiking, cooking, traveling, volunteering and participating in meditation retreats, and bodysurfing in a warm ocean, cooled by soft offshore breezes. Also 4x4 offroading, as of the strange year of 2020.

Early on in high school, some older friends of mine started an "internet company." This was back in '96 when you could be both an ISP and a web dev shop at the same time. I was mentored in both programming and networking, the latter of which I initially gravitated towards after college. I spent a decade working in IT, doing everything from help desk to management to DevOps to Product Development. I've since shifted towards the other end of tech, and have been building web backends and frontends. I enjoy writing code, and love talking entrepreneurship.

My personal mission is to connect with others by sharing my truth and offering my highest talents in service. I'm a strong proponent of personal integrity and individual accountability.  If you hear me say that I'm going to do something, I ask that you hold me accountable to my word. If we make plans to get a beverage two weeks from today on Thursday after work, you better believe that I'll be there! I want nothing more in life than to be part of the rising tide that lifts all ships. That and a mango orchard in the tropics.

Professionally, my mission is to co-found a software company serving Hawaii in 2026. I want to create apprenticeship and mentorship opportunities for kids like myself who had to travel to the mainland to start their careers in technology. I'm currently working to pick up the skills needed to make that dream happen. What's better than having a company picnic at the beach? Not much, that's what.

Short-term, I'm offroading in the Southwest and exploring off-the-beaten-path roads. If you know of any cool spots to check out, I'm all ears!

## Role

I'm an Engineer. My role is to empathize with and understand customer pain points, translate those into technical stories, chop those stories into thin slices, and ensure that members of my team, including myself, are able to get product shipped, and in doing so, to create exceptional experiences for the end-user. If product isn't getting shipped, it's my responsibility to help the team route around whatever obstacle is preventing us from delivering value to our customers.

## Values

- **Patience** allows everyone in the room the chance to have a voice
- **Compassion** leads to trust, understanding, and joy
- **Humor** keeps it from getting old, and helps when the going gets rough
- **Service** is the highest form of giving
- **Honor** drives our culture and teaches us which of our shared values are worth reaching towards

## My approach

I like writing clean, composable, reusable code. The first time through, I'll generally add an if statement. The second time through, I'll work towards a better abstraction and leave some notes. On the third pass, that abstraction gets pulled out and the code gets refactored. Yes, it adds time to the build. No, I'm not interested in pushing more technical debt onto the pile. Now is the proper time to refactor, and unless the business is going to fail if this doesn't ship today, this is when we pay back the interest on the technical debt. I could be totally wrong about this, and I work to consistently refine my approach.

I've recently become a big fan of Sandi Metz's 4 rules:

1. Classes should be no longer than 100 lines.
2. Functions should be no longer than 5 lines.
3. Functions should have no more than 4 arguments.
4. A single object is exposed across an endpoint or between a controller and view.

Now, this is how I strive to write my own code. I know this doesn't always work, but a lot of the time, it does. If you have a different approach and ask me for a code review, while I may give you some options along these lines for ways to improve your code, I will try my best not to impose my style upon you. There's likely a lot that I can learn from how you approach your work, and I'd like to keep us on good enough terms that we can have that sort of productive conversation in the future.

When we're pairing, anything goes, so long as we're on the same page.

## Successes

- **Writing self-documenting code** - I've gone back to old code I've written too many times and wondered what the heck I was trying to do. What I've learned is that if I assume I'll forget everything in a month, the quality of the code goes way up. Then there's the added benefit of freeing up brain space for other useful tasks, like choosing whether to order white rice or brown rice.
- **Giving others a platform on which to speak** - I enjoy hearing what others have to say, and I work to build an inclusive environment that gives everyone, introvert or not, a chance to share their views on the topic at hand.

## Quirks

- **Pull notifications** - I'm not the type of person who enjoys push notifications. I check email a couple of times a day, I'll check Slack from time to time, but if it's after-hours, I ask that you call or text me if something's up. I'm not ignoring you, I'm protecting my own sanity.
- **Flow state** - When I do manage to get into flow-state, I may not check email/Slack for hours on end. If something's on fire and I need to know, please text me or tap me on the shoulder.
- **Long periods of silence before responding** - I can sometimes go quite introspective prior to responding to something you've just said. If it seems like I'm thinking about something, you're right! That's exactly what I'm doing. My ask is that you give me a moment or two to come back to you with a response before you continue speaking.
- **Timeliness** - I make an effort to be on-time for meetings, and expect the same from others. If you're late to a meeting that I'm running, odds are that it started at the time we agreed to start. My ask is that you send a ping out if you expect to be late, that way we can work to adjust our agreed starting time.

## Receiving feedback

I strongly believe that feedback is a gift. If you care enough to give me some, I'll gladly receive it, regardless of content.

There's no such thing in my mind as positive or negative feedback, there's only how something I did impacted you and made you feel. If I did something that angered you, I welcome you to bring it up with me, as I want to know more about how you align with our shared values. Likewise, please share any feedback around things I've done that you appreciated so I can get a better sense of where to aim in the future. 

I do ask that you present your feedback in the form of data first, judgements second. This helps me identify the context first, so that I can better understand the emotional impact my actions may have had on you.

**Good**: "You pushed all the buttons in the elevator on the way down and then jumped out before the doors closed. You're a jerk!" ("jerk" is a judgement, not data)

**Bad**: "You should have checked with me before you merged that PR. I have an outstanding branch conflict that will take extra time to resolve, given the order that things were merged in, and there is a way to handle this that will result in less time expended for the both of us." ("you should have..."" is a judgement, not data)

## Favorite treat

A big bowl of fresh, organic strawberries, or a sunrise papaya with lime slice.

## Gifting

On the rare occassion that you might think it a good idea to buy me a thing, instead please consider donating to the Nature Conservancy's mission of [Planting a Billion Trees](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/plant-a-billion/). I send out my fair share of hot air, and any help balancing that is greatly appreciated.

# Thanks for reading!
